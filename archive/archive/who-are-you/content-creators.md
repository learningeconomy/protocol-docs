## Advanced

Sometimes you need more than the basic, out-of-the-box flows because you have a complex community or use case. That's great! All of our tooling is fully pluggable and open-source, so with a little elbow grease and developer time, you should be able to accomplish your goals.

**Don't have your own developers?** We're here to [help](../../../development/custom-development.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Build Your Own Bot**

Does your community use a platform not yet supported? Let's change that:

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### **Build Your Own Plugin**

Do you have a unique requirement, such as supporting a specific DID method, protocol, or system? You might need to build your own plugin:

{% content-ref url="../../../sdks/learncard-core/writing-plugins.md" %}
[writing-plugins.md](../../../sdks/learncard-core/writing-plugins.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
