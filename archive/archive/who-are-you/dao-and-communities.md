### **Are you using LearnCard?**

_We'd love to hear to hear from you! Share your story in our_[ _Github Discussions_](https://github.com/learningeconomy/LearnCard/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)_, or send us an email at_ [_community@learningeconomy.io_](mailto:community@learningeconomy.io)_â€”we'd love to feature your work ðŸ™Œ._

## Quick Start

These are some of the most common and quickest ways to get started.&#x20;

### #&#x31;**â€”Issue Credentials in your Community**

Great! You've decided that you would like to issue credentials in your communityâ€”achievements, skills, learning certificates, endorsements, identities, etc.&#x20;

#### First, you need to **identify what service, bot, or app you will use to issue your credentials.**

Flip through the tabs to learn more about each option:&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Discord Bot" %}
If your community already lives in Discord, one of the easiest ways to get started is to use our Discord bot.&#x20;

If you haven't already, **follow the instructions to get the Discord bot setup in your community,** then come back here!

{% content-ref url="../discord-bot.md" %}
[discord-bot.md](../discord-bot.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LearnCard App" %}
For peer-to-peer credential issuing, it's often easy to use the LearnCard app itself!

If you haven't already, get setup with LearnCard, then return here!

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Metamask Snap" %}
If your community heavily uses Metamask, there are ways to enable issuance flows through Metamask.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Experimental:** Metamask Snaps is in early beta with Consensys. Snaps, to date, can only be installed in the experimental [Metamask Flask ](https://metamask.io/flask/) - this is only required for _issuing_ credentials. Normal Metamask users may use regular Metamask to _claim_ credentials.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

If you haven't already, **follow the instructions to get Metamask setup in your community,** then come back here!

{% content-ref url="broken-reference" %}
[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Second, you need to _identify what credentials you will be issuing._

If you are using the VCTemplatesPlugin (enabled by default with LearnCard), there are a variety of default credential templates to help you get started quickly! Flip through the tabs to see some default options, and what information you will need to compile:&#x20;

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Achievement" %}
There are 4 main fields you will want for each achievement:

1. **Title**: the main way of identifying your achievement e.g. "Achievement Unlocked"
2. **Description**: common description of what this achievement represents.
3. **Narrative**: description of how someone earns this achievement.
4. **Image**: a picture representation of this achievement.

```json
// JSON Representation of Achievement
{
    "title": "Achievement Unlocked",
    "description": "This is a description",
    "narrative": "Earned by completing a basic tutorial on our website.",
    "image": "https://www.example.com"
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Learning Completion" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Skill" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ID" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Custom" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Check out the VC-Templates plugin for more options:

{% content-ref url="../../../sdks/official-plugins/vc-templates.md" %}
[vc-templates.md](../../../sdks/official-plugins/vc-templates.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Third, you need to configure your issuing platform to use your credential templates.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Discord Bot" %}
Use the `/create-credential` command. It will open a modal and walk you through creating a credential template, with first-class support for achievements, learning completions, skills, and IDs.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LearnCard App" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Metamask Snap" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### Then, start issuing credentials!

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Discord Bot" %}
Use the `/send-credential @<user>` command to start issuing credentials to your members.&#x20;

It will prompt you to select one of your credential templates from [Step 3](dao-and-communities.md#third-you-need-to-configure-your-issuing-platform-to-use-your-credential-templates.). Then, the LearnCard bot will send a direct message to your community member with steps on how they can claim their shiny new credential! :sparkles:
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="LearnCard App" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Metamask Snap" %}
Coming soon.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **#2â€”Verify Credentials in your Community**

In a community platform such as a DAO, you want to streamline the verification process of members' credentials for various use cases like achievements, courses, endorsements, gated content, proof of membership, hiring, and identity & KYC. You can achieve this using the CHAPI (Credential Handler API) and the LearnCard SDK. The following steps outline how an App Developer can accept and verify credentials in their platform using CHAPI and LearnCard SDK.

### Accepting Credentials using CHAPI

1. Import the CHAPI Polyfill into your platform based on your development environment. You can either use the script tag method for vanilla JavaScript or import the polyfill library in Node.js.
2. Construct a Verifiable Presentation Request using the desired credential types (e.g., AchievementCredential for recognizing members' achievements).
3. Wrap the Verifiable Presentation Request in a Web Credential Query, allowing your platform to request credentials from a user's digital wallet.
4. Request a Web Credential using the `navigator.credentials.get(credentialQuery)` function. The user will be prompted to present the requested credentials from their digital wallet.
5. Handle null results, which can occur when the user denies the request or does not have a wallet installed. As a developer, decide how to handle these situations by offering fallback mechanisms, retry options, or alternate paths.

See the [full CHAPI documentation for verifiers here](https://chapi.io/developers/verifiers).

### Verifying Credentials using LearnCard SDK

1. After receiving the credentials from the user's wallet, use the LearnCard SDK's [`learnCard.invoke.verifyCredential(signedVc)`](broken-reference) function to verify the received credentials.
2. Check the results of the verification to ensure the validity of the credentials. The result will contain an array of objects with status, check, and message properties.
3. If the verification is successful, proceed with the next steps specific to the use case (e.g., granting access to gated content or issuing proof of membership). Otherwise, handle the failed verification case by either requesting the user to provide valid credentials or implementing any other suitable action.

By integrating CHAPI and LearnCard SDK into your community platform, you can create a seamless and secure process for accepting and verifying member credentials for various use cases. This will not only streamline the verification process but also provide added security and trust in the credentials presented by the members, enhancing the overall community experience.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Did we miss your use case?** We'd love to chat and hear what you are working on to see how we can help. Post a question to our developer community, the Super Skills League, or shoot us an email at [sdk@learningeconomy.io](mailto:sdk@learningeconomy.io). &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Advanced

Sometimes you need more than the basic, out-of-the-box flows because you have a complex community or use case. That's great! All of our tooling is fully pluggable and open-source, so with a little elbow grease and developer time, you should be able to accomplish your goals.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Don't have your own developers?** We're here to [help](../custom-development.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Build Your Own Bot**

Does your community use a platform not yet supported? Let's change that:

[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### **Build Your Own Plugin**

Do you have a unique requirement, such as supporting a specific DID method, protocol, or system? You might need to build your own plugin:

{% content-ref url="../../../sdks/learncard-core/writing-plugins.md" %}
[writing-plugins.md](../../../sdks/learncard-core/writing-plugins.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Coming Soon

These features aren't yet available, but they are coming soon on our roadmapâ€”never to early too get excited!&#x20;

### LearnBank

* &#x20;:money\_with\_wings: **Earn-and-learn:** you want to incentivize learning in your community on a specific topic, or even incentivize people to learn _about_ your community.&#x20;
* :moneybag:**Gig Micropayments**: smart contract templates for issuing micropayments with proof of a verifiable credential, i.e. streaming payments and proof-of-work. Credential the actual tasks connected to a todo list; tracked with PVCs feeds reputation, ability to access things, ability to get paid autonomously.
