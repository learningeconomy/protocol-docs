## Setting Up Your Discord Bot

Now that you've gotten your Discord Bot installed in your community, let's get you setup to start issuing your first credentials.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£** ‚Äî**Configure Your first Issuer!**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.42.15 PM.png>)

In any channel, type `/configure-issuer`, which will prompt you to fill out information about your community's issuer.&#x20;

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.46.44 PM.png" alt="" data-size="original">

{% hint style="info" %}
When users receive a credential from you, it will be associated with the issuer profile you configure here. You may create more than one issuer profile.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Hit `Submit` and, if all went well, you should see a success message:

### **2Ô∏è‚É£**‚Äî**Create Your First Credential Template**

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.51.51 PM.png>)

In any channel, type the `/add-credential` command, which will allow you to setup a credential you would like to issue in your community.

First, it will prompt you to select a credential type, choosing among different **achievement, skills, learning history, work history** categories:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Achievements" %}
* Generic Achievement
* Formal Award
* Badge
* Community Service
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="IDs" %}
* License
* Membership
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Skills" %}
* Assessment
* Certificate
* Certification
* Competency
* MicroCredential
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Learning History" %}
* Assignment
* Course
* Degree
* Diploma
* Learning Program
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Work History" %}
* Apprenticeship Certificate
* Fieldwork
* Journeyman Certificate
* Master Certificate
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.52.53 PM.png" alt="" data-size="original">

Then, you can fill out the content of your credential template:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.56.04 PM.png>)

If all goes well, you should see your new credential template! ‚úÖ

{% hint style="info" %}
Right now the Bot doesn't natively support hosting an image for your credential. Although you can host your image anywhere you would like, a great option is [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/files/)&#x20;

Upload the image into [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/files/), then click ‚ÄúActions‚Äù on your uploaded image and click ‚ÄúView URL‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs the URL you want! It should look like: `https://<cid>.ipfs.nftstorage.link/`&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **3Ô∏è‚É£**‚Äî**Send Your First Credential**&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.58.18 PM.png>)

In any channel, type the `/send-credential @<user>` command, and @tag someone, which will allow you to send a credential to a user in your community.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.59.13 PM.png>)

The LearnCard bot will ask you which credential you would like to send to the user, and which issuer you would like to send the credential from:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-10-25 at 8.59.45 PM.png>)

‚úÖ Then, the LearnCard bot will send a direct message to your community member with steps on how they can claim their shiny new credential! :sparkles:&#x20;
