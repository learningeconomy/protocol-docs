# What is LearnCard?

[**LearnCard**](https://www.learncard.com) is a modular, open-source wallet and SDK designed to give learners and workers control over their credentials, achievements, and learning data. Built on open standards like [W3C Verifiable Credentials](core-concepts/credentials-and-data/verifiable-credentials-vcs.md) and [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](core-concepts/identities-and-keys/decentralized-identifiers-dids.md), LearnCard enables privacy-respecting, consent-based data sharing across educational and employment ecosystems.

Whether you're building edtech apps, issuing credentials, or designing learner-focused dashboards, LearnCard offers the foundation and flexibility to integrate trustworthy, portable data.

[**LearnCard**](https://www.learncard.com) is maintained by [**Learning Economy Foundation**](https://www.learningeconomy.io).&#x20;
