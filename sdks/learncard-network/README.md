# LearnCloud Network API

The **LearnCloud Network** provides backend infrastructure for managing verifiable credentials, digital identities, user profiles, and consent flows in the LearnCard ecosystem.&#x20;

This API provides a set of convenient endpoints that allow you to manage credentials, boosts, and presentations associated with user profiles. Here's a quick high-level summary of what you can do with the API:

1. **Profile Management**: Create, update, and search user profiles
2. **Credentials**: Send, accept, retrieve, and delete credentials between users on the LearnCard Network. Credentials can be used to represent skills, achievements, or other information related to a user's profile.
3. **Boosts**: Create, send, update, delete, and claim boosts for users on the network. Boosts are a way to reward and incentivize user interactions, such as completing tasks or participating in events.
4. **Presentations**: Send, accept, retrieve, and delete presentations between users. Presentations are packages of credentials that can be shared with others to demonstrate the user's skills or achievements.
5. **Consent Flow**: Manage consent contracts for data sharing and credential issuance
6. **DID Web Resolution**: Provide DID Web identity resolution
7. **Notification System**: Send notifications for various events
8. **Utilities**: Check the health of the API endpoint, retrieve a list of valid challenges, and obtain the LearnCard Network Decentralized Identifier (DID).
9. **Storage**: Store and resolve credentials or presentations using a unique identifier (URI).

**The LearnCard Network API** makes it simple to create engaging and interactive applications that utilize credentials, boosts, and presentations between users and applications.
