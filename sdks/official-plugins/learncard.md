# LearnCard

The LearnCard plugin adds opinionated logic specific to LearnCard wallet software. It is intended to make some of the less opinionated plugins more opinionated by wrapping their methods. Currently, this plugin is only wrapping the `verifyCredential` method from the `VC` plugin to provide an optional, more user-friendly verification output.

### Installation

```bash
pnpm i @learncard/learn-card-plugin
```
