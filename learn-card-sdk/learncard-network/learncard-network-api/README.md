# LearnCard Network API

**The LearnCard Network API** is designed to make it easy for developers to interact with the LearnCard Network. This API provides a set of convenient endpoints that allow you to manage credentials, boosts, and presentations associated with user profiles. Here's a quick high-level summary of what you can do with the API:

1. **Credentials**: Send, accept, retrieve, and delete credentials between users on the LearnCard Network. Credentials can be used to represent skills, achievements, or other information related to a user's profile.
2. **Boosts**: Create, send, update, delete, and claim boosts for users on the network. Boosts are a way to reward and incentivize user interactions, such as completing tasks or participating in events.
3. **Presentations**: Send, accept, retrieve, and delete presentations between users. Presentations are packages of credentials that can be shared with others to demonstrate the user's skills or achievements.
4. **Utilities**: Check the health of the API endpoint, retrieve a list of valid challenges, and obtain the LearnCard Network Decentralized Identifier (DID).
5. **Storage**: Store and resolve credentials or presentations using a unique identifier (URI).

**The LearnCard Network API** makes it simple to create engaging and interactive applications that utilize credentials, boosts, and presentations between users and applications.
