# Digital Credential Platform Integration Guide

This document outlines the requirements for integrating an external platform with a digital credential wallet system to enable automatic credential issuance to users across platforms.

## Integration Requirements

To create a seamless integration between an external platform and a digital credential wallet, the following components need to be developed:

### 1. User Account Connection

Establishing a connection between a user on your platform and their digital wallet requires implementing one of the following approaches:

#### Option A: Badge-Based Connection Flow

This approach uses a verification badge to establish the connection:

1. **Create a verification endpoint** that generates a unique verification credential for each user
2. **Implement a claiming interface** allowing users to connect their wallet by claiming this credential
3. **Store the DID association** after the user claims the credential (map your platform's user ID to their wallet DID)

#### Option B: ConsentFlow Integration

This approach uses a pre-defined consent contract:

1. **Implement a ConsentFlow contract** that requests minimal permissions needed for verification
2. **Create a connection interface** that directs users to authorize the connection via ConsentFlow
3. **Process the redirect callback** storing the user's DID when they return to your platform

### 2. Direct Credential Issuance API

Once user accounts are connected, you'll need an API to issue credentials directly:

1. **Authentication mechanism** to secure API access for trusted platforms
2. **User verification endpoint** to validate the connected user before issuance
3. **Credential issuance endpoint** accepting:
   - Connected user identifier (email, ID, or DID)
   - Credential template ID or parameters
   - Any achievement-specific metadata
4. **Status tracking functionality** to confirm successful issuance

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Required

1. **User Connection API**
   ```
   POST /api/connect-user
   {
     "platform_user_id": "string",
     "connection_method": "consent_flow|verification_badge",
     "callback_url": "string"  // Where to redirect after connection
   }
   ```

2. **Credential Issuance API**
   ```
   POST /api/issue-credential
   {
     "platform_user_id": "string",
     "credential_template_id": "string", 
     "achievement_data": {
       "name": "string",
       "description": "string",
       "achievement_date": "string",
       "evidence": "string",
       // Additional parameters as needed
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Connection Status API**
   ```
   GET /api/connection-status/{platform_user_id}
   ```

4. **Issuance Status API**
   ```
   GET /api/issuance-status/{transaction_id}
   ```

### Security Considerations

1. **API Authentication**: Implement API keys or OAuth 2.0 for secure platform-to-platform communication
2. **User Permission**: Ensure proper user consent is obtained before establishing any connection
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement appropriate rate limits to prevent abuse
4. **Audit Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all connection and issuance events

## Implementation Timeline

A typical implementation would require:

1. **API Development**: 2-3 weeks
   - Design and document API specifications
   - Implement user connection mechanisms
   - Develop credential issuance endpoints
   - Create status tracking functionality

2. **Testing & Integration**: 1-2 weeks
   - Develop test scenarios
   - Conduct integration testing with partner platforms
   - Performance and security testing

3. **Documentation & Support**: 1 week
   - Finalize technical documentation
   - Create integration guides for partners
   - Establish support procedures

## Getting Started

To initiate this integration:

1. **Exchange Technical Specifications**:
   - Share user identification methodologies
   - Define credential templates and parameters
   - Establish security requirements

2. **Create Development Environment**:
   - Set up sandbox environments for testing
   - Exchange test credentials

3. **Begin Phased Implementation**:
   - Start with user connection mechanism
   - Proceed to credential issuance once connections are working properly
   - Implement monitoring and reporting last

## Conclusion

This integration allows for a seamless user experience where achievements on one platform can automatically result in credentials being issued to the user's digital wallet without manual claiming steps. The implementation complexity is moderate, focusing primarily on secure user identification across platforms and automated credential issuance.
