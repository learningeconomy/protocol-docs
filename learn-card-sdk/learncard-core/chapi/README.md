# CHAPI

## What is CHAPI?

[CHAPI](https://chapi.io/) (**C**redential **H**andler **API**) is an open source protocol that allows conforming wallets to easily send and receive Credentials and Presentations to each other.

> CHAPI is an open protocol designed to solve the “NASCAR Problem” - too often, users are presented with a fixed set of options for authentication with third-party sites. The CHAPI protocol provides mediation between any CHAPI-enabled web application and a third-party site. Just register your web app with your browser, and off you go!
