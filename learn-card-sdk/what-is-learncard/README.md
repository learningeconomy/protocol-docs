# What is LearnCard?

## ðŸ‘‹ Meet LearnCard,

Your friendly companion for navigating the digital world of education and achievements!&#x20;

[**LearnCard**](../../learn-card-examples/learncard.md) is an app, platform, and sdk designed to make managing your digital identity and accomplishments a breeze, empowering both individuals and organizations to securely handle their credentials and growth experiences. It's like having a personal assistant to keep track of all your hard-earned accomplishments and share them with the world!

### About the SDK

The LearnCard SDK is an open-source digital wallet, ID, credentialing technology, UX, and network to enable any individual or organization to seamlessly **issue, earn, store, share, and spend currency and credentials.**

The SDK is built on W3C, IEEE, and DIF standards, including [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec), and [Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/).

The LearnCard is a key primitive in the trust triangle architecture for a [global network of learner wallets](../../get-started/protocol-overview/the-open-credential-network.md), published by Learning Economy Foundation.
