# What is LearnCard?

## Welcome to LearnCard

The LearnCard SDK is an open-source digital wallet, ID, credentialing technology, and UX to enable any individual or organization to seamlessly **issue, earn, store, share, and spend currency and credentials.**

### About

The SDK is built on the [W3C Universal Wallet (UW)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/), a packaging of draft standards and open source frameworks incubated by MIT DCC, Transmute, and Learning Economy Foundation. The UW includes key management and key rotation capabilities, [Verifiable Credentials (VCs)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/), [Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/did-spec), [Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)](https://identity.foundation/decentralized-web-node/spec/), and a trust triangle that operates modularly on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) with plug-ins for any layer 1 or layer 2 blockchain.&#x20;

The LearnCard is a key primitive in the architecture for a [global network of learner wallets](../../get-started/protocol-overview/the-open-credential-network.md), published by Learning Economy Foundation.
