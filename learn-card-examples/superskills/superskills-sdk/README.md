# SuperSkills! SDK

If you're interested in learning how to issue credentials into SuperSkills!â€”you've come to the right place! :tada:

This guide will walk you through everything you need to collaborate with our community. Most importantly, how to collaborate through the open protocols pioneering a new future where learners carry and share their achievements, recognition, and history from ecosystem to ecosystemâ€”on their own terms, through progressive, robust trust.

**First things first:** SuperSkills! is built on top of the [LearnCard SDK](broken-reference). LearnCard is our open-source technology for enabling learners and workers to issue, earn, store, and share credentials in a safe, trusted way. SuperSkills! is a version of LearnCard geared toward a learning game ecosystem for kids, developed in partnership with LEGO Foundation, where children earn holistic skills through play activities on a quest to help save a league of super heroes. The learner's digital wallet stores all of their credentials, achievements, badges and skills.

This guide is split into three different sections:

1. [**Digital Wallets**](digital-wallets.md)**:** background info on what digital wallets are and why they are important technology underpinning the SuperSkills! App.
2. [**Guide for Issuing into SuperSkills**](issuing-into-superskills.md)**:** overview of CHAPI, and how to use CHAPI to issue credentials into SuperSkills.
3. [**Guide for Creating a SuperSkills Issuer**:](creating-a-superskills-issuer.md) end-to-end guide on how to deploy an issuing service, using the LearnCard SDK, to issue credentials from your platform.&#x20;
