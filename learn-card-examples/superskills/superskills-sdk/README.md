# SuperSkills! SDK

If you're interested in learning how to issue credentials into SuperSkills!â€”you've come to the right place! :tada:

This guide will walk you through everything you need to collaborate with our community. Most importantly, how to collaborate through the open protocols pioneering a new future where learners carry and share their achievements, recognition, and history from ecosystem to ecosystemâ€”on their own terms, through progressive, robust trust.

**First things first:** SuperSkills! is built on top of the [LearnCard SDK](broken-reference). LearnCard is our open-source technology for enabling learners and workers to issue, earn, store, and share credentials in a safe, trusted way. SuperSkills! is a version of LearnCard geared toward a learning game ecosystem for kids, developed in partnership with LEGO Foundation, where children earn holistic skills through play activities on a quest to help save a league of super heroes. The learner's digital wallet stores all of their credentials, achievements, badges and skills.

, this guide is split into two different guides:

1. ****[**Guide for Issuers**](../../../get-started/who-are-you/plugfest-partner/guide-for-interop-issuers/): how to issue _from_ your issuing platform into our LearnCard app.&#x20;
2. ****[**Guide for Creating an Issuer**](../../../get-started/who-are-you/plugfest-partner/guide-for-interop-issuers/creating-an-interop-issuer.md): how to use LearnCard SDK to issue credentials from your platform.  LearnCard SDK as part of your platform or infrastructure for issuing or for your own wallet application. We have prepared two additional guides for these scenarios:

Additionally, if you haven't already, we would love for you to [**join our early access cohort**](broken-reference) as a collaborator in Plugfestâ€”to help strengthen open-source tools for the whole ecosystem!&#x20;
