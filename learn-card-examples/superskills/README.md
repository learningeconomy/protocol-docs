# SuperSkills!

**SuperSkills!**, developed in partnership with [LEGO Foundation](https://learningthroughplay.com/about-us/the-lego-foundation/), is a learning ecosystem where children ages 4-12 embark on quests to help save a league of super heroes by participating in learning-through-play activities that send them out into the world of discovery and away from their devices.&#x20;

As children journey through quests they develop cognitive, creative, social, emotional, and physical abilities. Along the way, they level up and prove their skills in a variety of learning-through-play environments. Learners collect skills and achievements that are verified for life in their own digital wallet, with special permission flows built in for guardians and teachers. It acts as a lifelong learning portfolio, to empower their teachers and prove their skills to future employers. The SuperSkills app, built with [LearnCard's plugin based developer kit](../../learn-card-sdk/what-is-learncard/), employs 4 credentialing verbs: Issue, Earn, Store, Share.&#x20;
