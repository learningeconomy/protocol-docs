# Metaversity

**Metaversity** is a lightweight wallet and pathways application that connects to any learning or employment system. It is built with [LearnCard's plugin-based software developer kit (SDK)](../learn-card-sdk/what-is-learncard/) to provide a scalable and customizable deployment for any training provider, school, college, employer, or DAO.
