# SuperSkills!

**SuperSkills!** is a learning game ecosystem and digital wallet for kids, developed in partnership with [LEGO Foundation](https://learningthroughplay.com/about-us/the-lego-foundation/). In the first version, children earn cognitive, creative, social, emotional, and physical skills through play activities on a quest to help save a league of super heroes.  It is built with [LearnCard's plugin based developer kit](../learn-card-sdk/what-is-learncard/).
