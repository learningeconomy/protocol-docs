description: What is the Learning Economy Protocol?
---

# Protocol Overview

Around the world, learning and employment systems create **fragmentation** across credentials, institutions, scholarships, content, schools, teachers, ed-tech providers, assessments, employers and beyond—systems silo learner data, creating poor ownership models and limiting network effects.

### **This fragmentation creates skills, equity, and mobility gaps.**

The **Learning Economy Protocol** provides a suite of tools, applications, and peer-to-peer protocols for everyone in the learning and employment ecosystem to:

* Systematically close skills gaps through verified skill networks and peer-to-peer discovery.
* Solve last mile equity challenges with earn-and-learn micro-scholarships.
* Create a global convention for mobility across borders.

Ultimately, the Learning Economy Protocol is a decentralized network of **self-sovereign learners** and lifelong learning data.&#x20;

### Key Concepts:

* ****[**The Internet of Education**](the-internet-of-education.md): a global shared vision and movement for a learner and employee centered future where every human on earth has equitable access to quality education and jobs.
* ****[**Learning Economy Foundation (LEF)**](the-learning-economy.md): translates leading edge technologies into transformative learning and economic systems that promote equity, mobility, privacy, and individual agency to radically improve lives throughout the world. LEF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, stewarding the LE Protocol.
* ****[**Learner & Employee Privacy**](learner-and-employee-privacy.md): Where does privacy fit in with web3 technologies? Is individual privacy a concern? How will the future protect individuals’ privacy, but also allow for personalized learning?
* ****[**22nd Century Education**](22nd-century-education.md): what is it, and how is it different than 21st century education systems?
* ****[**The Open Credential Network**](the-open-credential-network.md):  an open credential network, focused on building an interoperable protocol for the exchange, storage, and presentation of VCs.
* ****[**Programmable Verifiable Credentials (PVCs)**](pvcs.md): the shift from digital credentials to verifiable credentials to **programmable, verifiable credentials**.
