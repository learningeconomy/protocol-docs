# The Internet of Education

#### The Internet of Education is a global shared vision and movement for a learner and employee centered future where every human on earth has equitable access to quality education and jobs.&#x20;

The IoE is built around [10 guiding principles](https://www.internetofeducation.org/#Guiding-Principles) that galvanize a range of experts and stakeholders in the education and employment space to collaborate for solutions to existing inequities using emergent Web3 technologies. At this point it is heavily focused on the use of digital wallets. Digital wallets, as the name implies, are a tool that secures and holds a person’s skills and learning records, in much the same way as a physical wallet holds our money and credit cards. Using their digital wallet a person can capture and validate the skills they have and also identify the gaps they have in order to achieve their desired goals. They can then establish pathways to these goals; like a career or learning GPS.

Really important is that The Internet of Education governing principles guarantee the learners and employees will always be ‘self sovereign’. This means that they will own and control their own data, and they will be at the center of their own life’s journey. This is a big break from Web2 where ‘platforms’ own the majority of our data and that data is then used to serve the interests of the platform.

This has the potential to fundamentally change how we think about learning. Imagine a future where children can capture their learning experiences in a myriad of different environments - school, community centers, social volunteering, on-line gaming, care giving in their family - and that these are assimilated in a single place. The learner can then explore which learning approaches work best for them and, equally important, be able to validate their skill attainment to others through different approaches that best suit their preferred method of application, their circumstances and the context. Great learner confidence and less learning inefficiency.

Imagine a future where educators are able to trace the impact that they have had on a learners journey. Where they can specifically identify which teaching methods worked best for which students and which approaches were most effective at enabling the students to translate learning into practice. Greater educator development and accountability. Imagine a future where employers are able to link directly with learners and steer their development directly towards future employment opportunities and, if necessary, financially incentivize learning cohorts to develop the skills that will be most relevant in the emerging economy. Greater employer linkage up stream on skills attainment and less gaps for societal development.

This is the type of future we are looking to shape through the Internet of Education.
