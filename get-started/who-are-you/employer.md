# Employer

If you're an employer, and are interested in understanding how LearnCard can augment your workplaceâ€”you've come to the right place! :tada:

This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started. No prior experience required.

First things first: you need to identify your use case. **Why are you interested in using LearnCard in the first place?**&#x20;

### Some common use cases:

* **ðŸ’ª Workforce Development:** you want to issue skills, learning and employment certificates, achievements, and more when employees upskill and develop. _Start_ [_here_](employer.md#2-issue-credentials-for-up-skilling-in-your-organization)_._
* :white\_check\_mark: **Verification:** you want to verify skills, learning certificates, achievements, or another credential that a job applicant presents to you. Start [here](employer.md#1-verify-credentials-in-your-hiring-practice).

### **Are you using LearnCard?**

_We'd love to hear to hear from you! Share your story in our_[ _Github Discussions_](https://github.com/learningeconomy/LearnCard/discussions/categories/show-and-tell)_, or send us an email at_ [_community@learningeconomy.io_](mailto:community@learningeconomy.io)_â€”we'd love to feature your work ðŸ™Œ._

## Quick Start

These are some of the most common and quickest ways to get started.&#x20;

### #1**â€”Verify Credentials in Your Hiring Practice**

> ðŸš§ Coming soon

### **#2â€”Issue Credentials for Up-skilling in Your Organization**

To **issue credentials to your employees** this, you can either [setup your own, interoperable Issuer by following these steps](plugfest-partner/guide-for-interop-issuers/creating-an-interop-issuer.md), or you can [reach out to us for support and custom development to help connect your organization](../../community/custom-development.md).

{% content-ref url="plugfest-partner/guide-for-interop-issuers/creating-an-interop-issuer.md" %}
[creating-an-interop-issuer.md](plugfest-partner/guide-for-interop-issuers/creating-an-interop-issuer.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../community/custom-development.md" %}
[custom-development.md](../../community/custom-development.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Advanced

Sometimes you need more than the basic, out-of-the-box flows because you have a complex community or use case. That's great! All of our tooling is fully pluggable and open-source, so with a little elbow grease and developer time, you should be able to accomplish your goals.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Don't have your own developers?** We're here to [help](../../community/custom-development.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Build Your Own Bot**

Does your community use a platform not yet supported? Let's change that:

{% content-ref url="../../learncard-services/build-your-own-service.md" %}
[build-your-own-service.md](../../learncard-services/build-your-own-service.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### **Build Your Own Plugin**

Do you have a unique requirement, such as supporting a specific DID method, protocol, or system? You might need to build your own plugin:

{% content-ref url="../../learn-card-sdk/learncard-core/plugins/writing-plugins/" %}
[writing-plugins](../../learn-card-sdk/learncard-core/plugins/writing-plugins/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Coming Soon

These features aren't yet available, but they are coming soon on our roadmapâ€”never too early to get excited!&#x20;
