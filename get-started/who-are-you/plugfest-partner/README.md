# Plugfest Partner

If you're a participant in the [**JFF Interoperability Plugfest 2**](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-2-2022/), and are interested in learning how to interoperate with LearnCardâ€”you've come to the right place! :tada:

This guide will walk you through everything you need to collaborate with our community. Most importantly, how to collaborate through the protocols required in the [JFF Plugfest](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-ed/plugfest-2-2022/): [VC-API](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/)/[CHAPI](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/) & [OIDC](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1\_0.html).&#x20;

[Learning Economy Foundation](../../protocol-overview/the-learning-economy.md) is participating as _both_ a wallet, and an issuer. Therefore, this guide is split into two different guides:

1. ****[**Guide for Issuers**](guide-for-interop-issuers/): how to issue _from_ your issuing platform into our LearnCard app.&#x20;
2. ****[**Guide for Wallets**](guide-for-interop-wallets.md): how LearnCard Bridge can issue _into_ your wallet.

Additionally, based on some of our conversations, you may be interested in leveraging the LearnCard SDK as part of your platform or infrastructure for issuing or for your own wallet application. We have prepared two additional guides for these scenarios:

1. ****[**Guide for Creating an Issuer**](guide-for-interop-issuers/creating-an-interop-issuer.md): how to use LearnCard SDK to issue credentials from your platform.
2. ****[**Guide for Creating a Wallet**](../../../learn-card-sdk/learncard-core/chapi/chapi-wallet-setup-guide.md): how to use LearnCard SDK to create your own wallet application.

Additionally, if you haven't already, we would love for you to [**join our early access cohort**](broken-reference) as a collaborator in Plugfestâ€”to help strengthen open-source tools for the whole ecosystem!&#x20;
