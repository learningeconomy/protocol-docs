### Some common use cases:

* :mortar\_board: **Lifelong Resume:** you want to store skills, credentials, learning certificates, and achievements earned from many different placesâ€”at school, online, from a workshop, at a museum, etc.â€”and you want to be able to share them with a potential employer or school.

### #1**â€”Setup Your LearnCard**

## Advanced

Sometimes you need more than the basic, out-of-the-box flows because you have a complex community or use case. That's great! All of our tooling is fully pluggable and open-source, so with a little elbow grease and developer time, you should be able to accomplish your goals.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Don't have your own developers?** We're here to [help](../../super-skills-league/custom-development.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### **Build Your Own Bot**

Does your community use a platform not yet supported? Let's change that:

{% content-ref url="../../learncard-services/build-your-own-service.md" %}
[build-your-own-service.md](../../learncard-services/build-your-own-service.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### **Build Your Own Plugin**

Do you have a unique requirement, such as supporting a specific DID method, protocol, or system? You might need to build your own plugin:

{% content-ref url="../../learn-card-sdk/learncard-core/plugins/writing-plugins/" %}
[writing-plugins](../../learn-card-sdk/learncard-core/plugins/writing-plugins/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
