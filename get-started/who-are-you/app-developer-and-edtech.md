# App Developer & EdTech

If you are an app developer, ed-tech provider, or systems architect and are interested in understanding how LearnCard can augment your existing platformâ€”you've come to the right place! :wrench:

This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started. Baseline experience and familiarity with software development tooling and processes is expected. No prior knowledge of decentralized identity or verifiable credentials necessary.

First things first: you need to identify your use case. **Why are you interested in using LearnCard in the first place?**

### Some common use cases:

* :mortar\_board:**Courses**: users complete courses and curriculum in your platform or app, and you are interested in issuing achievements, skills, learning certificates, IDs, and more that can be recognized in the broader ecosystem. _Start_ [_here_](app-developer-and-edtech.md#1-sign-and-send-credentials-in-your-platform)_._
* :handshake: **Hiring:** candidates search for work opportunities and/or hiring managers validate job applications in your platform, and you are interested in streamlining the verification process of credentials from many different sources inside an ecosystem. _Start_ [_here_](app-developer-and-edtech.md#2-accept-and-verify-credentials-in-your-platform)_._
* :unlock:**Gated Content:** you want to enable your users to gate content based on the validation of specific credentialsâ€”community membership, skills, achievements, accomplishments, endorsements, etc. _Start_ [_here_](app-developer-and-edtech.md#2-accept-and-verify-credentials-in-your-platform)_._
* :ballot\_box\_with\_check: **Proof-of-progress:** you want to integrate verifiable progress within your platform, such as credentials issues for completing a task [list](app-developer-and-edtech.md#1-sign-and-send-credentials-in-your-platform). &#x20;
* :credit\_card: **Identity:** you want to enable your users to anchor verifiable, decentralized identities with your platform. _Start_ [_here_](app-developer-and-edtech.md#1-sign-and-send-credentials-in-your-platform)_._
* :video\_game: **Metaverse & Games:** you want to integrate LearnCard into your digital experiences and games, enabling issuing, recognition, and/or validation of credentials within your ecosystem. Start [here](app-developer-and-edtech.md#1-sign-and-send-credentials-in-your-platform).
